  # Description
  My motivation for working on this project was to show my skill in with the inquirer npm as well as connecting to a SQL server.
  I build this specifically to show my skills in these areas.  
  This will help solve a future issue for future employers.  This is a fantastic tool to show that I have the basics of these topics.
  I learned a lot about how to go about pulling data from the server to be inputed into prompts.
  
  # Installation
  I started on this project by working on the schema and the seeds for the SQL information.  After ensuring those worked, I had to make my index.js file  with the inquirer prompts in it.  I then had to work on pulling data from the database for all of the funtioncs within the prompts.
  
  # Usage
  This application's use is to demonstrate my abilities.
  
  # Credits
  I worked on this project primarily alone, but with some help from a tutor to help with  issues I was having on the SQL queries.
